# This is my coding preparation for career

I am NOT a good coder, but I insist to do the practice as far as I am working in the field of computer science.
Give me any advice if you think it's helpful, thank you.

## Leetcode
### My primary coding language:
    1. Python (for AI project, too many frameworks rely on it)
    2. C++ (for regular system development)
    3. C (for Operating System precticing usage)

## Database related
  1. PL/SQL (the first structured language I learned in my first engineering job)
  2. T-SQL, MySQL as candidate practicing (minor difference to PL/SQL, learn the difference)
